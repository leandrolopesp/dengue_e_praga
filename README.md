# dengue_e_praga
This project is a Pico-8 game that makes a homage to the "Brazilian Queen of the Little Ones", Xuxa (sounds like 'shoosha').

If you were born in Brazil from (who knows when?) and something like 1988, you will remember that Xuxa had a very popular TV Show, Xou da Xuxa.
In this show she had two stage assistants with the names Dengue - yes, a tropical disease name - and Praga (Plague).

In this game, somehow Xuxa's ship falls on Earth and it is up to you to find all the pieces, assemble it back and then take her back to her show. 

The game is based on Toejam & Earl, a classic Mega Drive/ Genesis videogame.

It still haves a lot to be done to be properly a game.
